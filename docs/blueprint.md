HealthQuest ‚Äì Gamified Wellness & AI-powered Early Diagnosis Assistant
Team Name: GHIlli gang

In an age where health awareness is crucial, especially from a young age, "HealthQuest" envisions a gamified ecosystem combined with AI-driven medical guidance, designed to promote a healthy lifestyle and preventive care awareness among children and families.

The platform comprises two key modules:

1. üéÆ Gamified Health Learning (for Kids & Families):
This interactive game introduces a virtual character with common health challenges like cold, fever, or diabetes. Through playful scenarios (e.g., "The character wants tea, but has diabetes‚Äîhelp them decide the safe sugar amount"), players earn points by making healthy decisions. Such real-life inspired micro-decisions gradually help children and even adults internalize health-conscious habits in a fun, non-preachy way.

2. ü§ñ AI HealthBot ‚Äì Symptom Checker & Local Assistance:
Users can click on a ‚ÄúDoubt‚Äù button instead of typing, and select symptoms such as "fatigue", "sadness", or "body heat". Based on the chosen combination, the AI predicts possible issues (e.g., fever) and recommends visiting the nearest clinic, using Google Maps integration for directions. For more help, it provides day-wise advice (e.g., visit by Monday) and minimal medicine suggestions for basic issues like common cold, low fever, etc.

What sets HealthQuest apart is its non-textual chatbot interaction ‚Äî designed especially for children and rural users with limited typing experience. The app runs mostly on taps and selection, making it accessible, engaging, and inclusive.

Together, this blend of gaming and AI healthcare assistance ensures that users not only play but learn, inspire their families, and take timely preventive action. Instead of only treating illness, HealthQuest fosters a culture of understanding wellness from childhood itself.
